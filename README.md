This is the movie recommendation model which works on NLP and vectorization of tokens

it basically converts genre,language,ratings and overview into tokens and then takes the average of all those tokens into a single vector for movie
later then it compares it to several movies with for similar score movies in the data set

the model i used was Word2Vec from gensim
